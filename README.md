# ConstraintPreserver

### A Constraint-Preserving Document Retrieval and Question-Answering System

ConstraintPreserver is a Python-based document retrieval and question-answering system designed to retrieve relevant information from documents while preserving important constraints, conditions, and contextual details.

The project focuses on improving the reliability of document-based question answering by combining document preprocessing, intelligent chunking, semantic search, and constraint-aware answer generation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Extract and preprocess information from documents.
* Divide documents into meaningful chunks for efficient retrieval.
* Generate semantic embeddings for document chunks.
* Perform similarity-based retrieval using FAISS.
* Identify and preserve important constraints from retrieved information.
* Generate contextually relevant answers based on retrieved documents.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture consisting of the following stages:

**1. Document Preprocessing**

* Document extraction and cleaning.
* Text normalization.
* Document validation.

**2. Document Chunking**

* Dividing documents into smaller chunks.
* Maintaining relevant contextual information.
* Generating structured document metadata.

**3. Vector Indexing**

* Generating semantic embeddings.
* Storing embeddings in a FAISS index.
* Maintaining associated chunk metadata.

**4. Semantic Retrieval**

* Converting user queries into embeddings.
* Searching for relevant document chunks.
* Retrieving the most relevant information.

**5. Constraint Extraction**

* Identifying important conditions and restrictions.
* Preserving critical information during answer generation.

**6. Answer Generation**

* Generating answers using retrieved document context.
* Maintaining consistency with the original document information.
